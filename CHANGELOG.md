Day 1: Foundation & API Integration

1. Project Setup & Core Architecture (Morning):
   Choose a tech stack: For speed, I'd lean towards something familiar and efficient. Likely:
   Frontend: React (or Vue, if preferred) for rapid UI development.
   Backend: Node.js with Express.js for simple API endpoints.
   Database: SQLite or a simple JSON file for minimal persistence (if needed).
   Set up the project structure, including version control (Git).
   Establish basic routing for the frontend and backend.

   Let's use this template.

2. Gemini API Integration (Afternoon):
   Obtain API keys and set up authentication.
   Implement the core logic for sending user messages to the Gemini API and receiving responses.
   Create a simple API endpoint in Node.js to handle chat requests.
   Test the API integration with basic text prompts to ensure it's working.

   API Connection established. Make api folder for later.

3. Basic Chat UI (Evening):
   Create a simple chat interface with:
   An input field for user messages.
   A display area to show the conversation history (user messages and Gemini responses).
   A "Send" button.
   Basic styling to allow for readability.

   Day 2: Enhancements & Basic Functionality

4. Conversation History Management (Morning):
   Implement logic to store and display the conversation history.
   Handle scrolling and display of longer conversations.
   If using a database, implement the code to store the history.
5. Error Handling & User Feedback (Afternoon):
   Implement basic error handling for API requests (e.g., network errors, API rate limits).
   Provide visual feedback to the user (e.g., loading indicators, error messages).
   Add a visual cue to show when the AI is "typing".
6. Basic Styling & UI Refinement (Evening):
   Add basic styling to improve the look and feel of the chat interface.
   Ensure the UI is responsive to different screen sizes.
   Test cross browser compatibility.
   Day 3: Polishing & Deployment (If Possible)

7. Input Sanitization & Security (Morning):
   Sanitize user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting).
   Ensure that API keys are not exposed in the frontend code.
8. Basic Context Management (Afternoon):
   Implement a simple mechanism to pass the conversation history to the Gemini API to maintain context.
   This may be as simple as sending the last few messages in the request.
9. Testing & Deployment (Evening):
   Perform thorough testing to identify and fix any remaining bugs.
   If time permits, deploy the chatbot to a platform like Vercel or Netlify for easy access.
   If deployment is not possible, prepare a demo to show the functionality.
   Key Considerations:

Scope Reduction: Focus on core functionality. Avoid unnecessary features.
Rapid Development: Prioritize speed over perfect code.
Clear Communication: Communicate progress and potential roadblocks to the team (if any).
Testing: Test frequently and thoroughly.
API Limits: Be mindful of API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling mechanisms.
Security: Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., API keys) is handled securely.
Features to Exclude (for the MVP):

Advanced UI features (e.g., rich media, custom styling).
User authentication and authorization.
Complex context management (e.g., long-term memory).
Integration with other services.
Voice input/output.
By focusing on these core features and prioritizing rapid development, we can deliver a functional AI chatbot within the three-day timeframe.
